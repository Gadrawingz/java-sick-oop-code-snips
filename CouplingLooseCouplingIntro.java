/************************************
 * LOOSE COUPLING:
 * @ Loose coupling means, They are mostly independent.
 * @ Generally speaking, Loose coupling is better than Tight c.
 *
 * @ LOGIC: If the only knowledge that class A has about class B, is what class B
 * has exposed thru its interface, then class A & class B are said to be loosely coupled.
 *
 * @@ In order 2 overcome from problems of tight coupling b2n objects,
 * Spring framework uses dependency injection mechanism with the help of POJO/POJI
 * model & through dependency injection, it possible 2 achieve loose coupling.
 *
 * LOGIC: If u change yo shirt, then u are not forced to change yo body.
 * When u can do tha, when u can't do that, then u have tight coupling.
 *
 * @1 Low dependencies b2n "artifacts" (classes, modules, components)
 * @2 There shouldn't be too much of dependency b2n the modules,
 * even if there's a dependency, it should be via the interfaces & should be minimal.
 *
 *
 * Example of Loose coupling: Interface, JMS
