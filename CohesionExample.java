/******************************************
 * Cohesion:
 * @ In programming, Refers to the degree to w/c the elements inside a module belong together.
 * @ The term cohesion is used to indicate the degree to which a class has:
 * a single, well-focused responsibility.
 *
 * @ Cohesion is a measure of how the methods of a class or a module are meaningfully &
 * strongly related & how focused they're in proving a well-defined purpose 2 the system.
 *
 * @ In implementation, cohesion is the OOPrinciple most closely associated with making
 * sure that a class is designed with a single, well-focused purpose.
 *
 * TYPES OF COHESION:
 * @ Cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement & usually described as 'High&low cohesion
 *
 * a) Low cohesive: is identified as class w/c contains many unrelated functions within it.
 * We need to avoid it bcz, big classes with  unrelated functions hamper their maintaining.
 *
 * b) High cohesion:
 * b1. Code has 2 be very specific in itsoperations.
 * b2. The responsibilities/ methods are highly related to the class/module.
 * b3. Always make your class small & with precise purpose & highly related functions
 *
 * HIGH COHESION:
 * -------------
 * @@ Modules with High cohesion is preferable bcz it is associated with
 * several desirable traits of software including:
 * i) Robustness, Reliability, Re-usability & understandability
 * While LOW COHESION comes with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain,
 * reuse & even understand.
 * 
 * LOW COHESION
 * @ Is when a class does a lot of jobs don't have much in common.
